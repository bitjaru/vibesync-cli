### 3. User Response
- "Proceed" → Adopt recommendation
- "Alternative A" → Choose alternative
- "Hold" → Decide later

### 4. Auto Record

**Alternatives**:
- Iamport: Korea only (no international)
- Toss: Subscription feature still lacking
**Decided By**: CTO + Dev team
**Code Location**: `src/services/PaymentService.ts`
```

### ❌ Bad Decision Record

```markdown
### Yesterday - Something decided
**Category**: Important
**Decision**: This one
