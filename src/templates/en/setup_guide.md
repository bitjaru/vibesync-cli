## 📋 Your Mission

You are tasked with analyzing this multi-repository workspace and creating a comprehensive collaboration system. Follow these steps **interactively** - ask the user for confirmation at each major decision point.

---

## 🎯 Step 1: Understand the Workspace

### Detected Repositories

[REPO_LIST]

### Your Task
1. **Analyze each repository** by examining:
   - File structure and dependencies
   - Tech stack and frameworks
   - Project purpose and architecture
   - Existing code patterns

2. **For each repository, determine**:
   - Primary function (backend, frontend, mobile, fullstack)
   - Main technologies used
   - Key features and modules
   - Development patterns

---

## 🔄 Step 2: Interactive Setup Process

### For Each Repository:

#### 2.1 Confirm Repository Analysis
Present your analysis to the user:
```
📁 Repository: [repo-name]

My analysis:
- Type: [backend/frontend/mobile/fullstack]
- Tech Stack: [detected stack]
- Description: [your generated description]
- Key Features: [list main features]

Is this analysis correct? Any adjustments needed?
```

#### 2.2 Ask Critical Questions

**⚠️ NEVER infer these - always ask:**

1. **API Endpoints** (for backend):
   - "What is the main API base URL?"
   - "Are there multiple API versions?"

2. **Business Logic**:
   - "What are the key business rules I should know?"
   - "Any specific pricing/payment policies?"

3. **Authentication**:
   - "What authentication method is used?" (JWT, OAuth, Session, etc.)
   - "Where are tokens stored?" (cookies, localStorage, etc.)

4. **Database**:
   - "What database is used?"
   - "Any critical schema information?"

5. **External Services**:
   - "Which external APIs/services are integrated?"
   - "Any API keys or credentials I should be aware of (without exposing them)?"

#### 2.3 Identify Discussion Keywords

Ask the user:
```
For this project, which critical keywords should trigger automatic discussion pauses?

Suggested categories:

🔴 CRITICAL (Always pause):
- 💰 Payment/Billing: payment, billing, charge, refund, subscription, invoice, pricing, fee
- 🔐 Security/Auth: authentication, authorization, login, logout, session, token, jwt, password, encrypt, decrypt, hash, salt, oauth, permission, role, admin
- 🗑️ Data Deletion: delete, remove, drop, truncate, destroy, purge, erase
- 📜 Privacy/Legal: GDPR, CCPA, personal data, PII, privacy policy, terms of service, consent, compliance

🟡 IMPORTANT (Recommended pause):
- 🔌 External APIs: API integration, webhook, third-party, external service, API key, credentials
- 🗄️ Database Schema: migration, schema change, alter table, add column, drop column, index, constraint
- 🚀 Deployment/Infra: deploy, deployment, production, environment, server, hosting, domain, SSL, certificate
- 💾 Caching: cache strategy, redis, memcached, CDN, cache invalidation
- 📧 Email/Notifications: email sending, SMS, push notification, notification service

🟢 MINOR (Optional pause):
- ⚡ Performance: optimization, performance, caching, lazy loading, code splitting, bundle size
- 🧪 Testing: test strategy, testing framework, CI/CD, automated testing
- 📊 Logging/Monitoring: logging, monitoring, analytics, error tracking, APM
- 🎨 UI/UX: design system, theme, responsive, accessibility, internationalization

Which categories should I enable? (Recommend: CRITICAL + IMPORTANT)
Any custom keywords specific to your domain?
```

## 📝 Step 3: Generate Documentation Files

For each repository, create these files in `.claude/` folder:

### 3.1 CLAUDE.md
- Project information from your analysis
- Absolute rules (TypeScript strict mode, error handling, etc.)
- No-inference zones (business logic numbers, API URLs, security settings)
- Discussion-required keywords (from user's selection)
- Comment tag system (@codesyncer-* tags)
- Project-specific templates and patterns

Use template: `./templates/[lang]/claude.md`
- Replace [PROJECT_NAME], [PROJECT_TYPE], [TECH_STACK]
- Replace [KEYWORDS] with user-confirmed keywords
- Add project-specific rules discovered during analysis

### 3.2 ARCHITECTURE.md
- Complete folder structure (scan actual directories)
- File statistics
- Comment tag statistics (initial: all 0)
- Tech stack details
- Dependencies from package.json

Use template: `./templates/[lang]/architecture.md`
- Actually scan and list real folder structure
- List actual dependencies

### 3.3 COMMENT_GUIDE.md
- Comment tag usage guide
- Examples specific to this project's tech stack
- Search commands

Use template: `./templates/[lang]/comment_guide.md`
- Use as-is (already comprehensive)

### 3.4 DECISIONS.md
- Decision log template
- Category definitions
- Empty decision records (to be filled during development)

Use template: `./templates/[lang]/decisions.md`
- Use as-is (decisions added during work)

---

## 🌐 Step 4: Generate Master Document

At the workspace root, create `.codesyncer/MASTER_CODESYNCER.md`:

### Content:
- List all repositories with their roles
- Automatic repository switching rules
- Keyword-based navigation mapping
- Multi-repo workflow examples

Use template: `./templates/[lang]/master.md`
- Replace [REPO_TABLE] with actual detected repos
- Replace [KEYWORD_MAPPING] with repo-specific keywords
- Replace [PROJECT_NAME], [GITHUB_USERNAME]

---

## ✅ Step 5: Final Confirmation

After generating all files, present a summary:

```
✅ CodeSyncer Setup Complete!

Created files:
📁 .codesyncer/
   └── MASTER_CODESYNCER.md

📁 [repo1]/.claude/
   ├── CLAUDE.md
   ├── ARCHITECTURE.md
   ├── COMMENT_GUIDE.md
   └── DECISIONS.md

📁 [repo2]/.claude/
   └── (same files)

Next Steps:
1. Review the generated files
2. Customize any project-specific rules in CLAUDE.md
3. Start developing with: "Read CLAUDE.md" in each repo

Ready to start using CodeSyncer!
```

## 🎨 Customization Guidelines

### For Backend Projects:
- Focus on API structure in ARCHITECTURE.md
- Add API endpoint documentation
- Emphasize security and data handling rules
- Include database schema if provided

### For Frontend Projects:
- Document component structure
- Include styling approach (CSS modules, Tailwind, etc.)
- Add state management patterns
- Document routing structure

### For Mobile Projects:
- Document screen navigation
- Include platform-specific notes (iOS/Android)
- Add native module integrations
- Document build/deployment process

### For Fullstack Projects:
- Combine backend + frontend guidelines
- Document API ↔ UI integration
- Include data flow patterns
- Add deployment strategy

## 🚨 Critical Rules for AI Assistants

1. **Always ask, never assume** for:
   - Business logic numbers
   - API endpoints
   - Security configurations
   - Database schemas

2. **Be thorough** in analysis:
   - Read actual code, don't guess
   - Check package.json dependencies
   - Scan folder structure completely
   - Identify code patterns

3. **Be interactive**:
   - Ask for confirmation at each step
   - Present your analysis before generating
   - Allow user to correct your understanding

4. **Use @codesyncer-* tags** in all examples:
   - All code comments use new format
   - Explain @claude-* compatibility
   - Show proper tag usage

## 📚 Template Placeholders

When generating files, replace these:

- `[PROJECT_NAME]` → User's project name
- `[PROJECT_TYPE]` → backend/frontend/mobile/fullstack
- `[TECH_STACK]` → Detected tech stack (comma-separated)
- `[TODAY]` → Current date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `[GITHUB_USERNAME]` → User's GitHub username
- `[KEYWORDS]` → User-confirmed discussion keywords
- `[REPO_TABLE]` → Formatted table of repositories
- `[KEYWORD_MAPPING]` → Keyword → Repo mapping
- `[TEMPLATES]` → Project type-specific templates
- `[REPO_LIST]` → List of detected repositories

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Setup is successful when:
- ✅ All repositories have complete .claude/ folders
- ✅ Master document created with accurate repo mapping
- ✅ User confirmed all critical information
- ✅ No assumptions made about business logic or secrets
- ✅ All documentation uses @codesyncer-* tag format
- ✅ Project-specific patterns documented
