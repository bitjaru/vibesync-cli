## 🚨 Important Rules

### 1. Check Repository Before Working
Always verify which repository you're working in:
```bash
pwd  # Check current directory
```

### 2. Read CLAUDE.md When Switching Repos
Every time you work in a new repo:
```
"Read [repo-name]/.claude/CLAUDE.md"
```

### 3. No Work in Root Directory
Never code in root directory. Always navigate to specific repo before working.

---

## 🔄 Multi-Repo Workflow

### Scenario 1: User Specifies Specific Repo
```
User: "Add login API to backend"
       ↓
1. Check MASTER_CODESYNCER.md for "backend" keyword → find api-server repo
2. Read api-server/.claude/CLAUDE.md
3. Work in api-server
```

### Scenario 2: Multiple Repos Need Changes
```
User: "Add order feature"
       ↓
1. "Order feature requires both backend (API) and frontend (UI). Proceed?"
2. After user confirmation
3. Work on API in api-server → report completion
4. Work on UI in web-client → report completion
```

### Scenario 3: Unclear Which Repo
```
1. Check keyword mapping in MASTER_CODESYNCER.md
2. If unclear, ask user
   "Which repo should I work in?"
   - A) api-server (backend)
   - B) web-client (frontend)
   - C) mobile-app (mobile)
```

## 📝 Project-Wide Common Rules

The following rules apply to **all repositories**:

### Coding Standards
- ✅ Use TypeScript strict mode
- ✅ Explicit type definitions required
- ✅ Prefer functional programming
- ✅ Document all functions/components
- ✅ Error handling required

### Comment Tag System
Use the same tags across all repos:
```typescript
@codesyncer-rule        // Special rules
@codesyncer-inference   // Inference with reasoning
@codesyncer-decision    // Decisions after discussion
@codesyncer-todo        // User confirmation needed
@codesyncer-context     // Business context explanation
```

Details: `.claude/COMMENT_GUIDE.md` in each repo

### No-Inference Zones
**Never infer, always ask the user:**
- 💰 Business logic numbers (prices, fees, limits, discounts)
- 🔌 API endpoint URLs
- 🔐 Security settings (token expiry, encryption methods)
- 🗄️ Database schema
- 🌐 External service integration details

### Discussion-Required Keywords
When these keywords are detected, **stop work automatically** and discuss with user:
- 🔴 **CRITICAL**: payment, billing, auth, permission, delete, personal data, GDPR
- 🟡 **IMPORTANT**: API integration, DB schema, deployment, caching, email
- 🟢 **MINOR**: optimization, testing, logging, UI/UX

Full keyword list: `.codesyncer/MASTER_CODESYNCER.md`

   - Explain clearly when order matters

3. **Common Code Management**
   - Discuss location for shared types, utilities
   - Establish duplication prevention strategy
